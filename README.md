# Musti - Web Music Player.

Musti is a web-based music player application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It serves as a demonstration project showcasing fundamental UI/UX principles for music apps and illustrating how to handle and display song data (simulating JSON or API responses) within a front-end application.

**Project Goals & Learnings Demonstrated:**

* **Data Handling:** Structuring and utilizing song data (title, artist, source, banner) within the application.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically creating and updating HTML elements (like the song list and track info) using JavaScript.
* **HTML5 Audio API:** Effectively using the `<audio>` element and its events (`play`, `pause`, `timeupdate`, `ended`) for playback control.
* **UI/UX Implementation:** Building essential interactive components:
    * Standard playback controls (Play/Pause, Next, Previous).
    * A visual progress bar displaying playback time and duration, with seeking functionality.
    * Dynamic playlist generation and interaction (clicking list items to play).
    * Visual feedback for the currently playing track.
* **State Management:** Managing basic application state (e.g., `isPlaying`, `currentSong`).
* **User Experience:** Implementing features like a persistent Dark/Light theme toggle using Local Storage.

**Key Features:**

* Load and play audio tracks.
* Standard playback controls: Play/Pause, Next, Previous.
* Visual progress bar with track duration display and click-to-seek.
* Displays current song title, artist name, and associated banner image.
* Dynamically generates a playlist from song data.
* Allows users to select songs directly from the playlist.
* Highlights the currently active song in the list.
* Dark/Light mode toggle with theme persistence.

**Tech Stack:**

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Vanilla JavaScript
* JSON (for structuring song data - simulated)
